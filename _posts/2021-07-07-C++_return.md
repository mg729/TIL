## return
- return 문이 실행 될 때 함수가 제어를 호출측으로 되돌려주게 된다.

> *Void functions are created and used just like value-returning functions except they do not return a value after the function executes. In lieu of a data type, void functions use the keyword "void." A void function performs a task, and then control returns back to the caller--but, it does not return a value. You may or may not use the return statement, as there is no return value. **Even without the return statement, control will return to the caller automatically at the end of the function.** A good utilization of a void function would be to print a header/footer to a screen or file.*


-  need for an explicit return at the end of the function. return; is optional code at the end of the funtion
